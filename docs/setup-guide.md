## ⚙️ Setup & Environment

1. **Install Node.js & MongoDB**

2. **Create `.env` files in both `/backend` and `/frontend`**

Example for `backend/.env`:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/realtimeapp
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Start the App

Start backend & frontend separately:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

---

## 🧪 Run Tests

**Open Cypress Test UI:**
```bash
cd frontend/tests
npx cypress open
```

**Headless test with code coverage:**
```bash
npx cypress run
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

To run everything using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To stop:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 📊 Code Coverage

After running Cypress with coverage plugin:

```
frontend/tests/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

Open that file in your browser to view full HTML coverage reports.

---

## 💬 WebSocket Features

- 🔁 Real-time collaborative editing
- 💬 Instant chat updates
- 👤 Presence indicators (who's online, typing)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use?**  
  Stop conflicting processes or change the port in `.env`.

- **MongoDB not connected?**  
  Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud DB URI.

- **Cypress test failures?**  
  Ensure the frontend and backend are both running before launching tests.
